Bash Brains
A Bash Library (and Eventually Management System for Such)
http://github.com/ess/bashbrains

PURPOSE
=======

To fulfill the requests that my employer has made of me in recent months, I've
been writing a ton of bash scripts.  Almost invariably, I've been re-using a
ton of general-purpose methods (several of which are included with bash brains),
and It's occurred to me that this would all be a lot easier if we had the
same mechanism for bash that Ruby and Perl have in (respectively) gems and
CPAN.

INSTALLATION
============

install.brains.sh

If you would like to specify a prefix, simply do so as follows:

PREFIX=/path/to/whatever install.brains.sh

USAGE
=====

For the moment, the only command available with the brains utility is "core,"
which returns the full location of the brains core include file.

To use bash brains in your scripts, you need to source the core include.
Since the location of the core include file is not necessarily known, one
may use the above "core" facility to source it:

source "$( brains core )"

You can now use any of the methods that are defined in the brains core, and you
can also source other brains:

source 'time'
source 'file'

The default behavior for the "source" command is to directly source the given
file.  If the given path does not exist, the brains library path is then
searched, and the brains module in question is loaded if present.

Eventually, the brains utility will provide a listing of both installed and
remote brains packages as well as a mechanism by which to install and remove
said packages.  Really.  It's in the TODO file.
