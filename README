Bash Brains
A Bash Library (and Eventually Management System for Such)
http://github.com/ess/bashbrains

INSTALLATION
============

install.brains.sh

If you would like to specify a prefix, simply do so as follows:

PREFIX=/path/to/whatever install.brains.sh

USAGE
=====

For the moment, the only command available with the brains utility is "core,"
which returns the full location of the brains core include file.

To use bash brains in your scripts, you need to source the core include:

source "$( brains core )"

You can now use any of the methods that are defined in the brains core, and you
can also source other brains:

source 'time'
source 'file'

The default behavior for the "source" command is to directly source the given
file.  If the given path does not exist, the brains library path is then searched
and the brains module in question is loaded if present.
